# Kickstarter Challange Campaign Outcome Analysis

## Overview of Project: Analysis was done on the Theater Category in the Kickstarter Challange Campaign. 

### Purpose: To help visualize campaign outcomes based on thier launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges: To help provide insight into how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals, analysis was done on data involving outcomes, parent categories, years, and the date created.  Some of the challenges encountered was ensuring that the needed data was clearly generated and displayed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: May launched the most successful campgains, and the top three most successful months are May, June and July. January, March, September, and November roughtly had the same number of failed campgains launched. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The most successfuly campgains had goal less than $1,000 and a goal between $1,000 and $4,999.  As the goal amounts increased in number, the failure rate is typcially higher.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results: I would recommend that campaigns are launched between a window of May to July and target the goal amount to be between $4,999 and less than $1,000.

- Two conclusions about Outcomes based on Launch Date is that April and May had the lowest percentage of failures and that May and June had the highest percentage of successes. May is the best month to launch a campaign and December would be the worst month.

- Based on the the Outcomes based on Goals data, percentage-wise a campaign with a goal under $1,000 is the most successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Some potential limitations is that any outliers were not removed.  A better insight could be had with the removal of the larger goals.

- Another table that could be useful would be one that would help apply descriptive statistics and a Box and Whisker chart.
